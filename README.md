# Simple Resume Parser

## Overview

This project is a simple Resume Parser that uses the ChatGroq API to extract key details from resumes such as

- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Phone Number**
- **Technical Skills**
- **Soft Skills**
- **Experience**
- **Total Years of Experience**

By leveraging the ChatGroq API, the parser can efficiently process resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to capture relevant information, helping recruiters and hiring managers to quickly access essential candidate details


## How It Works

   The parser utilizes the ChatGroq API, which uses Meta Llama 3.0 to extract specific details from resume text. Hereâ€™s a high-level workflow

  - **Extract Text**: Uses pdfplumber for PDFs, docx for DOCX files, and pytesseract for image-based text extraction
  - **Call ChatGroq API**: Sends the extracted text to the ChatGroq API with a template prompt to identify and extract relevant details
  - **Save Output**: The extracted information is formatted and saved to a CSV file for easy access and analysis
